# Survival-game
## University project for OOP course 

A console program made in C++ that simulates a 2D battle game between 3 types of characters(*terrorists*, *counter-terrorists* and *mercenaries*) and the last man standing wins. The characters can also find power-ups on table to increase their chance to win and have their own strategy.
